        <!--Main text content-->
        <p class="text-center"> I am currently studying web development at the University of Birmingham, with the hopes
            of pursuing a career in web development. After graduating from York St John Univeristy in 2014 with a BA
            Joint Honours in History and American Studies, I worked in retail for a year before moving to South Korea. I
            worked as an ESL teacher teaching elementary school children at 3 different schools. This was a very
            rewarding experience and I gained a lot of skills from it, such as communication and planning. <br /><br />
            Living in a different country for a year truly enhanced my personality and skillset and it was a very
            rewarding experience. However, upon my return to the UK I found myself without any real goals for the
            future. Since graduating I have thought a lot about going back into education, but I never took the leap.
            <br /> <br />
            That was until I saw an advertisement for the coding bootcamp at the University of Birmingham. I have some
            experience with HTML and CSS and it has always been a keen interest of mine but I could never find the time
            or resources to properly learn how to code. I am glad that I decided to take a leap of faith and enrol and I
            look forward to learning more about coding and web development and starting my career.
