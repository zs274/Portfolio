# Responsive Portfolio
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a responsive portfolio that could be viewed on a variety of devices and screen sizes without losing any functionality or visibility. 

The main goal was to use Bootstrap as much as possible and I managed to to create the whole website without using any external CSS styling. I wanted a simple look for my portfolio and it was very easy to edit colours within bootstrap to give this grey and white colour scheme. 
The navbar expands on bigger screens to list the various headings and collapses on smaller screens into a toggle button, so there is no loss of functionality or visibility. The layout and images also respond in the same way, resizing themselves to fit the screen size. 

The hardest part of this assignment was making sure that all of the elements were in the correct order in their respective HTML sheets but I think this skill will become easier with time. I enjoyed making the carousel for the portfolio section and hope to build on it more in the future. 

I also made a mistake in not properly looking at the given images and I chose to do a carousel for my portfolio page. After speaking with my tutor I realised that I had to change the format and instead change it into a grid with image thumbnails. In the future I will pay attention to these details more so that I don’t end up working in vain.
