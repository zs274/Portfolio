# Portfolio
For this assignment, we were tasked withÂ creating a responsive portfolio that displays our information as well as websites we have worked on. We also had to update other aspects of our portfolio including our resume and Linkedin profile. 

## Difficulties
The main difficulty I had with this project was working with the CSS and making my background cover images responsive on mobile. This took quite a lot of time but I'm glad I now understand it. Another difficutly was updating my Linkedin as I have no previous experience using it. I also don't yet know how to make the contact form actually work and so I would like to come back to this at a later stage and fix that aspect. 

## Overall thoughts
I found this assignemnt challenging but fun as I enjoyed being given the creative freedom and not having a starter code or example images to follow. I would like to come back to edit my portfolio when I have learnt more so that I can make it more interactive.
